# GitHub Commands Demo

This repository was created as part of our group project to **practice and test Git/GitHub workflows**.  
It serves as a sandbox for learning and experimenting with version control commands and collaboration features.

---

## 🚀 Purpose
- Understand and practice essential Git commands.  
- Explore GitHub workflows: branching, merging, pull requests, conflict resolution.  
- Learn collaboration in a shared repository.  
- Build confidence before contributing to the main project.

## 🛠️ Commands Practiced
Some of the key Git commands we are testing here:
- `git init` → Initialize a new repository  
- `git clone` → Clone repo from GitHub  
- `git add` → Stage changes  
- `git commit` → Save changes locally  
- `git push` → Upload commits to GitHub  
- `git pull` → Fetch and merge from remote  
- `git branch` / `git checkout` → Work with branches  
- `git merge` → Combine branch changes  
- `git log` / `git status` → Track repo state
